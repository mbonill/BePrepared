# BePrepared
This is a reminder app. It helps the user to remember to bring important items depending on their destination. The user
inputs a list of destinations. For each destination they can add a list of items. Upon heading out they can access a
checklist of those items. Timer mode allows the user to set an alarm to remind them. GPS and Wifi modes work on boundary
detection to determine when the user is leaving and notify them to use a checklist.
